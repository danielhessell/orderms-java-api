## :zap: Technologies

This project was developed with the following technologies:

- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/br/java/)
- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

## :computer: Getting started

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com)

- [Java v21.0.5](https://www.oracle.com/br/java/technologies/downloads/#java21) or heigher.

Docker is a containerization tool where we will be able to eliminate project configuration tasks between different machines and guarantee a development environment as close as possible to the production environment.

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. And in this scenario, we will use it to automate the execution of our API container next to the database.

- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Also, itâ€™s good to have an editor to work with the code like [IntelliJ IDEA Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
